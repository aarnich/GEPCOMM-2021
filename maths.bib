  abstract = {The study aims to identify the factors that affect the achievements of students in Mathematics and to determine the relationship between the students' achievements and individual, instructional, classroom management and evaluation factors. The 239 Bachelor of Elementary Education students were the subjects of the study. The descriptive-correlational design was used. Data were subjected to statistical analyses using t-test, Pearson r and multiple regression. Findings reveal that: 1. achievements of students in Math Courses (Fundamental Mathematics and Contemporary Mathematics) is poor; 2. students perform low in both subjects; 3. mathematics achievements are highly correlated to individual and instructional factors and moderately correlated to classroom management and evaluation factors; 4. individual factor and instructional factor greatly affect achievements in fundamental math; 5. instructional factor is the number one predictor of achievement in contemporary math; and 6. instructional factor is the factor that affects most the achievements of students in Mathematics.},

  abstract = {The Philippines implemented its educational reform commonly known as K to 12 Program in 2013 for Filipino learners’ holistic development and global competitiveness. One indicator of the reform’s effectiveness is the country’s performance in international large-scale assessments like the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), if it participates again in 2019. To gauge readiness and inform decisions on its participation, this study examines the alignment of TIMSS 2015 Assessment Framework vis-à-vis the 2016 Philippine’s K to 12 Curriculum in Mathematics and Science. Through curriculum mapping of experts on the competencies in the two documents, the study reveals that K to 12 Mathematics Grade 4 is more aligned with TIMSS 2015 Assessment Framework than that of Math Grade 8, Science Grade 4, and Science Grade 8. The study recommends continuous curriculum improvement of the Philippine’s K to 12 Curriculum and implementation of relevant intervention programs and support system from different education stakeholders, including country-based publishing and testing companies to address gaps on competencies found for the country to meet international benchmarks.},

  abstract = {As major sources of information, curriculum materials (CMs) have generally served teachers and students by providing instructional and learning support. The impact of CMs on teachers’ pedagogical practice and learners’ engagement and success had been fairly documented. However, just as the use of CMs is influenced by teachers’ orientations and learners’ identity with the subject matter, the same can be said for textbook writers who attend, interpret and respond to curriculum content and standards. Guided by Dietiker, Males, Amador and Earnest (2018)’s curriculum noticing construct, this study examined the epistemological features of Philippine secondary school mathematics textbooks of the Department of Education. Four textbooks, one from each grade level, were analyzed via a directed qualitative content analysis. Following the inductive approach, significant statements from the texts were culled and organized through coding, categorizing and abstraction using a repertory grid. Member checking was done to validate the findings of the study. Interestingly, the study afforded the development of the Onion Model of Curricular Noticing Dynamics in Mathematics Textbooks. The model reveals how CM writers frame the mathematics curriculum in the design and development of textbooks. Specifically, the encountering frame lays emphasis on their interaction with the mandated curriculum through an examination of curricular elements. In the sense-making frame, writers reflect on four curricular questions leading to an understanding of the curriculum and the context in which it operates. Finally, the operationalizing frame captures the unique moves observed by textbook writers in developing the materials. The emerged model can serve as a valuable means in achieving heightened consciousness among textbook writers as they develop materials that promote teacher learning and respond to learners’ needs, interests and orientations.},

  abstract = {Students from all levels (elementary to tertiary levels) regard mathematics as a difficult subject. This has been evident in their performances not only in the classroom but also in the local, national and international achievement tests. Students' difficulty in mathematics can be attributed to several factors, one of which is the teacher. The teacher has direct contact with students on a daily basis and therefore been considered to have a direct impact on students' achievement. Studies, such as that of Brophy and Good (1986), Hiebert (1999) and the National Research Council (1999) have found that teacher-level factors are the main contributing factors that influence students' performance. Hence, this study investigated whether teaching and assessment practices (collectively called classroom practices) have influenced students' achievement. Other teacher-level factors, such as teachers' attitudes towards teaching mathematics and efficacy beliefs in mathematics were also examined. School-level and student-level factors were also deemed to have a direct or indirect effect on teachers' classroom practices and students' achievement. This study employed a cross-sectional design. Since this study basically identified and investigated the factors that influence outcomes (e.g. students’ achievement), a quantitative research approach was therefore employed. Survey questionnaires used were first validated. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used in examining the scale structures, while item response theory (IRT) using Rasch model analysis was utilised to examine the scales at the item level. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to ascertain the causal relationship between the variables in each level. Since this study involves three levels of data, school-, teacher- and student- level, a multi-level analysis, particularly, Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was employed. Findings show that only teachers’ level of education and participation in professional development activities have significant effects on students’ achievement in mathematics. Surprisingly, both teachers' teaching practices and assessment practices did not appear to be significant predictors of students’ achievement. Results at the school-level show that school principals' management or leadership style has a direct positive influence on school climate for learning. School climate, in turn, provides a learning environment that enhances students learning, thus, increasing their performance. Moreover, students’ achievement in mathematics could also be affected by their attitudes towards mathematics, which are measured in this study in terms of their confidence in learning mathematics and usefulness of mathematics. Likewise, students’ beliefs about mathematics appeared to have a positive effect on mathematics achievement. It is interesting to note that students’ mathematics anxiety has no significant effect on their achievement. The findings of the study suggest that students' achievement in mathematics are significantly influenced by multi-level factors, either directly or indirectly. This likewise indicates that school principals, teachers, and students must all be engaged in maintaining a healthy learning environment. It would be beneficial for future research to investigate more deeply on the specific measures of teaching and assessment practices. Implications for educational policies, practice, theory and research are discussed.},

Since, the usual top-down one-shot cascading model practice for teachers’ professional development in Philippines has been observed to have much information dilution, and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization demanded the need to develop mathematics teachers’ quality standards through the Southeast Asia Regional Standards for Mathematics Teachers (SEARS-MT), thus, an intensive, ongoing professional development model should be provided to teachers. This study was undertaken to determine the impact of Lesson Study on Bulua National High School mathematics teachers’ quality level in terms of SEARS-MT dimensions. A mixed method of quantitative–qualitative research design was employed. Results of the analysis revealed that Lesson Study effectively enhanced mathematics teachers’ quality and promoted teachers professional development. Teachers positively perceived Lesson Study to be beneficial for them to become a better mathematics teacher.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses how an eighth grade mathematics teacher engaged his students in hands-on activities, made them work on tasks in small groups, encouraged them to solve problems in different ways, and seized their mistakes as learning opportunities. Although the way he carried out these teaching practices still requires much improvement, these enabled the students to make sense of mathematics by discovering mathematical relationships on their own, communicating their ideas and reasoning logically, exploring various ways of solving problems, and regarding making mistakes as part of learning. These experiences put the students as the most important factor in the teaching-learning process. Such is a big departure from the traditional classroom scenario where the teacher is the source of all learning. A CONTEXT FOR GOOD MATHEMATICS TEACHING PRACTICES In order to understand what good mathematics teaching practices mean in relation to the class described in this paper, it is necessary to know the characteristics of mathematics classes in the Philippines generally, the recommendations of the Department of Education on strategies in teaching mathematics, and the perceptions},
