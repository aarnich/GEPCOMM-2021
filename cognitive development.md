The instruction of Mathematics has, throughout history, been linked to the idea that students, with the use of skills developed in class, may be able to learn and adapt in order to solve problems. (Tripathi, n.d.) posits that all Mathematics educators must constantly question themselves if the Mathematics they teach lead to the enhancement of students' cognitive abilities. Ideally, the students, when presented with a new situation, must be able to delve into previously learned Mathematical schema (in terms of concepts, processes, and ideas). Afterwhich, students must be ready to mold their existing knowledge in order to quantify new problems and formulate new solutions.
