Introduction

How should mathematics be taught in Filipino classrooms? In a country that ranks amongst the lowest in Mathematical acuity (Schwab, n.d.), it is a subject that commonly inspires fear and anxiety in students. The simple notion that Mathematics could be an enjoyable pursuit is foreign to many Filipinos, student or otherwise. There is a cognitive bias against mathematics that often results to a negative perception towards the subject. Filipino students believe in the importance of Mathematics and its permeating need in daily life but they do not possess the competence nor the desire to actively enjoy doing Mathematics (Alova, 2021).
