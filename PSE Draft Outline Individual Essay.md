Introduction

How should mathematics be taught in Filipino classrooms? In a country that ranks amongst the lowest in Mathematical acuity (Schwab, n.d.), it is a subject that commonly inspires fear and anxiety in students. The simple notion that Mathematics could be an enjoyable pursuit is foreign to many Filipinos, student or otherwise. There is a cognitive bias against mathematics that often results to a negative perception towards the subject. Studies show that Filipino students believe in the importance of Mathematics and its permeating need in daily life but they do not possess the competence nor the desire to actively enjoy practicing the subject (Alova, 2021).

Mathematics is a fundamental component of [[cognitive development]] for Filipino students today, yet the subject is often misinterpreted as a series of steps to be abstracted and forgotten after examinations. The critical importance of teaching Mathematics lies in the subject's 

Critical thinking is a learned skill that requires instruction and practice. Mathematics education instructors at both the secondary and post-secondary levels can enhance studentsâ€™ critical thinking skills by (i) using instructional strategies that actively engage students in the learning process rather than relying on lecture and note memorization, (ii) focusing instruction on the process of learning rather than solely on the content, and (iii) using assessment techniques that provide students with an intellectual challenge rather than memory recall. Several barriers can impede critical thinking instruction.
